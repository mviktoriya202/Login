**Front-End Test: Login Interface Implementation Documentation**

**1. Introduction**

This documentation outlines the implementation details of the Qencode Login UI using React, as per the provided Figma design and Authentication API specification. The project has been developed using modern web technologies including React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, and Axios. It follows the FSD architecture ,aims to deliver a responsive and user-friendly login interface.

**2. Project Setup**

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the provided Git URL.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your web browser using the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

**3. Components Structure**

The project comprises several reusable React components corresponding to different pages as specified in the Figma design. These components include:

- `LoginPage`: Responsible for rendering the login form and handling user authentication.
- `ForgotPasswordPage`: Renders the forgot password form and facilitates password recovery.
- `ResetPasswordPage`: Displays the reset password form for users to reset their passwords.

**4. Design Implementation**

The design implementation closely follows the provided Figma design. Modern CSS techniques, including the use of Tailwind CSS utility classes, have been employed to achieve the desired layout. Attention has been paid to details such as font sizes, padding, and margins to match the design accurately. The components are responsive and adapt well to both mobile and desktop views.

**5. Functional Implementation**

- **React State and Props**: React's state and props have been effectively utilized to manage form data and validations across the components.
- **Client-side Validation**: Input validations have been implemented for email and password fields. Email validation ensures the input follows a valid email format, while password validation enforces a minimum length of 8 characters.
- **API Integration**: Axios has been used to integrate the forms with the provided API endpoints. The application handles different API response scenarios, such as successful login, login failure, password reset success, and password reset failure.

**6. Error Handling**

Error handling mechanisms have been implemented to inform users of any input mistakes or API request issues. Conditional rendering in React is used to display or hide error messages as needed, providing a seamless user experience.

**7. State Management**

The project utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux facilitates the centralized management of application state, ensuring data consistency and enabling efficient communication between components. Actions and reducers have been defined to manage user authentication and password reset processes.

**8. Conclusion**

This documentation provides an overview of the implementation details of the Qencode Login UI using React. The project demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies and adherence to design specifications and best practices. Further enhancements and optimizations can be made based on specific project requirements and feedback.
